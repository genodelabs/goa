This is a basic example of VFS server usage. It demonstrates how
the VFS component is able to serve a (virtual) file system to another component.
In this example, an fs_query component integrates this file system into its
own VFS.

In particular, this example shows how the VFS server serves a subdirectory
to the fs_query component and how the latter overlays the file "verbose" with
its own version.
