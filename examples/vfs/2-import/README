This example demonstrates the use of POSIX operations, the RAM file system and
the VFS import plugin. The only component in this scenario is a POSIX
application which performs a bunch of file operations. The component's VFS
comprises a RAM file system, a ROM file '/tmp/static', and a special log file.
The log file is used for connecting the C runtime's stdout to Genode's LOG
session. The VFS import plugin is used to populate the RAM file system with a
file '/tmp/x' with the content from a ROM module.

The POSIX component tries writing to the immutable '/tmp/static' file,
reads the content of '/tmp/x', and overwrites it with some new content.
