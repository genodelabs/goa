This is a very basic example of VFS usage. It demonstrates the VFS
configuration by defining a directory structure and static files. The fs_query
component is used for querying one or multiple directories. It outputs the
result in form of a report that is shown by the report_rom component.

Note that the fs_query component tries but fails watching the VFS for changes
because the VFS is immutable.
