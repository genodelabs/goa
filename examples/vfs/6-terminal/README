This example demonstrates the use of the VFS terminal plugin. A producer
component writes to a terminal pseudo-file in its VFS. The write operation
is translated into Terminal-session operations. Via a terminal_crosslink
component, which interconnects two Terminal clients, a consumer component is
able to read the written data.
