                                  Pirmin Duss


The _api_ file defines the include paths required by users of a project that
produces a library.


Syntax
######

The file consists of an arbitrary number of lines where each line refers to a
path relative to the build directory. The paths select the files and
directories to be featured in the api archive of the library.
If a path refers to a directory, all contained files are included.

Note that the build directory also contains an _install_ subdirectory which is
used as a destination directory for running *make install* after a successful
build. When extracting include paths from the install subdirectory, the
_install/_ prefix is removed.


Examples
########

:include/spdlog.h: The file _include/spdlog.h_ from the build directory is added as a single
  header file.

:include/spdlog/: All files found in the directory _include/spdlog_ below the build directory are
  added as artifacts. The relative directory structure is kept intact.

:install/include/spdlog: All files found in the directory _install/include/spdlog_ below the build
  directory are added as artifacts to _include/spdlog_ of the api archive.
