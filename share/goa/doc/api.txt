                                  Pirmin Duss


The 'api' file defines the include paths required by users of a project that
produces a library.


Syntax
######

The file consists of an arbitrary number of lines where each line refers to a
path relative to the build directory. The paths select the files and
directories to be featured in the api archive of the library.
If a path refers to a directory, all contained files are included.


Examples
########

*include/spdlog.h*

The file 'include/spdlog.h' form the build directory is added as a single
header file.

*include/spdlog/*

All files found in the direcory 'include/spdlog' below the build directory are
added as artifacts. The relative directory structure is kept intact.
