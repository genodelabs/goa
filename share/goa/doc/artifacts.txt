The 'artifacts' file defines the build artifacts produced by the build system.


Syntax
######

The file consists of an arbitrary number of lines where each line has the
following structure:

! [<container>:] <selector>

The <selector> is the path to a file or directory within the build directory
to be featured in the binary archive.

The optional <container> specifies the form of how the build artifacts should
be stored in the binary archive. If omitted, each selected file becomes a
distinct ROM module in the binary archive. By specifying a <container>,
multiple files can be aggregated into a single archive file, which is then
supplied to Genode as a single ROM module.

Multiple lines can refer to the same container, appending the artifacts
to the same container.


Examples
########

*install/bin/ls*

The 'ls' executable binary is taken from the build directory's 'install/bin/'
sub directory as a single ROM module named 'ls'.

*install/bin/*

All executable binaries found at the build directory's 'install/bin/'
sub directory are turned into ROM modules.

*coreutils.tar: install/bin/ls*

The single executable binary 'ls' is archived at the root of the
'coreutils.tar' archive, which, in turn, becomes available as ROM module.

*coreutils.tar: install*

The entire 'install' sub directory within the build directory is archived
into the 'coreutils.tar' archive. The archive contains an 'install' directory
at the root of the archive.

*coreutils.tar: install/*

All files within the build directory's 'install' sub directory are archived
into the 'coreutils.tar' archive. The files are located at the root of the
archive.

*coreutils.tar/usr/local/bin/: install/bin/ls*
*coreutils.tar/usr/local/bin/: install/bin/cp*

The executable binaries 'ls' and 'cp' are archived within 'coreutils.tar'.
The archive contains two entries '/usr/local/bin/ls' and '/usr/local/bin/cp'.
