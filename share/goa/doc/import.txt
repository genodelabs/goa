                               Johannes Schlatow


The 'import' file defines how to download, extract and patch 3rd-party source
code.


DESCRIPTION
###########

Syntactically, the file is a makefile that merely defines a couple of variables
that steer the import procedure. The file is included by the Genode's ports,
which evaluates the following mandatory variables:

:LICENSE:
  This variable defines the license of the 3rd-party source code.

:VERSION:
  This variable defines the version of the 3rd-party source code.

:DOWNLOADS:
  This variable defines a list of downloads in the form of '<name>.<type>'. The
  <name> part is arbitrary and used for referencing in the URL, DIR and REV
  variables. Supported <type> values are 'file' (a plain file), 'archive' (an
  archive of the types tar.gz, tar.xz, tgz, tar.bz2, or zip), 'svn' (a
  subversion repository), and 'git' (a git repository).

:URL(<name>):
  This variable defines the URL of a certain download.

:DIR(<name>):
  This variable defines the directory relative to the project directory where
  the 3rd-party source code is going to be located.

:SHA(<name>):
  For downloads of type 'file' or 'archive, this variable defines the SHA256
  hash of the downloaded file.

:REV(<name>):
  For downloads of type 'git' or 'svn', this variable defines the revision
  to be checked out.

In addition, the following optional variables are available that allow modifying
the directory structure and source code once it has been downloaded.

:DIRS:
  Defines a list of additional directories to be created.

:DIR_CONTENT(<dir>):
  Lists the content of directory <dir>. The paths are relative to the project
  directory and may contain wildcards. Note that <dir> must be present in DIRS.

:PATCHES:
  Defines a list of patch files that are going to be applied to the source code.

:PATCH_OPT:
  Sets command line options supplied to the 'patch' command. Default: -p0


EXAMPLES
########

The following content of an 'import' file instructs Goa to clone a certain git
repository and checkout commit 'ba8881e2c9afb2f2345bd1df8d6b42cd1deadb08'. This
is conducted in the contrib directory. The content is then copied into the
'src/' subdirectory of the project.

! LICENSE := BSD
! VERSION := 1.2.3
! DOWNLOADS := foobar.git
!
! URL(foobar) := https://...
! REV(foobar) := ba8881e2c9afb2f2345bd1df8d6b42cd1deadb08
! DIR(foobar) := src

Let's assume there are a few patches necessary to adapt the 3rd-party source
code to Genode. These patches are present in the 'patches' subdirectory. Goa is
then instructed to apply all the '*.patch' files found in this directory to the
checked out source code as follows:

! PATCHES := $(notdir $(wildcard patches/*.patch))

Furthermore, let's assume there is a 'background.png' file needed, which would
like to pack up in a raw archive. The file is present in the checked out git
repository and can be placed into the 'raw/' directory with the following lines
added to the 'import' file:

! DIRS := raw
! DIR_CONTENT(raw) := src/resources/background.png
