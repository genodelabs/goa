Goa is a tool for streamlining the development of application software for the
Genode OS Framework. The work flow is project-centered. A project is a
directory that may contain source code, data, instructions how to download
source codes from a 3rd party, descriptions of system scenarios, or
combinations thereof. Goa is independent of Genode's regular build system.
It combines Genode's package management (depot) with commodity build systems
such a CMake. In addition to building and test-driving application software
directly on a Linux-based development system, Goa is able to aid the process
of exporting and packaging the software in the format expected by Genode
systems like Sculpt OS.


PROJECT
#######

A project is named after its directory.

It can have the following ingredients:

:import: A file that describes how 3rd-party software is downloaded and
  patched for the use with Genode. It follows the lines of Genode's
  time-tested 'ports' tool described at
  https://genode.org/documentation/developer-resources/porting.
  Note, import may populate 'src/' and 'raw/'. It will therefore overwrite
  any existing content in these directories.

:src/: A directory containing source code and build instructions. Goa
  automatically detects the kind of build system used. In particular,
  if the src/ directory contains a CMakeLists.txt file, CMake is used.
  If a plain Makefile is encountered, Goa assumes the use of GNU Make.

:used_apis: A file containing a list of APIs used by the project.

:raw/: A directory containing raw data such as images or configurations.

:artifacts: A file that describes the build artifacts to be taken from
  the build directory after a successful build.

:api: A file that describes the header files that comprise the public
  interface of a library. It is only needed when building libraries.

:pkg/: A directory containing descriptions of runtime scenarios for
  test-driving the project.

:var/: A directory that contains files generated during the operation
  of Goa, e.g., the build directory.

:version: A file containing the current version string of the project.

:LICENSE: A file denoting the project's licensing terms, which is
  supplemented whenever a source-archive is exported from the project
  via the 'export' or 'publish' commands.

:cmake_args: A file containing a list of project-specific arguments
  passed to CMake.

:make_args: A file containing a list of project-specific arguments
  passed to Make when using a plain Makefile project or an Autoconf
  project.

:configure_args: A file containing a list of project-specific arguments
  passed to the configure script of an Autoconf project.
!

Any given project may feature a subset of those files or directories.
For example, a plain port of a 3rd-party software package may contain
only 'import', 'used_apis', 'artifacts', 'version' and LICENSE files.
As another extreme, a project may only feature a 'pkg/' directory with
scenarios that plug existing Genode components together.
Be aware, that a project must not contain a 'src/' or 'raw/' directory
along with an 'import' file and vice versa.


USAGE
#####

:goa help [<topic>]:
  Show the documentation about the specified topic.
  Available topics are 'overview' (this document), 'config', 'artifacts',
  'add-depot-user', 'build-systems'

:goa update-goa [<version>]:
  Update the Goa tool to the latest minor version if called without
  argument, or switch to the major version specified as argument.

:goa versions:
  Print available versions of the Goa tool.

:goa --version:
  Print current major version of the Goa tool.

:goa import:
  Download and patch 3rd-party source code according to the rules given by
  an 'import' file.

:goa diff:
  Show local modifications of the imported 3rd-party software.

:goa build-dir:
  Create a build directory.

  If an 'import' file exists, this command automatically invokes the 'import'
  command.

:goa build:
  Invoke the build system and extract the resulting build artifacts
  according to an 'artifacts' file. See 'goa help artifacts' for more
  information about the syntax of an 'artifacts' file.

  This command implies the 'build-dir' command.

  Note that the building of libraries is supported only via cmake.

:goa extract-abi-symbols:
  Extract the abi symbols for a library project. This command is for the
  use of library maintainers only.
  The output is a file 'symbols/<library-name>'. For each library in the
  list of artifacts (recognized by the ending '.lib.so').
  You should review the files and add them to the repository.
  They are required by users of the library during the 'build' step.

:goa run [--pkg <pkg-name>]:
  Execute a system scenario defined at pkg/<pkg-name>. If no argument
  is supplied, <pkg-name> is assumed to correspond to the name of the
  project directory.

  This command implies the 'build' command.

:goa export [--depot-user <name>] [--pkg <pkg-name>]:
  Export entire project to a Genode depot. If <pkg-name> is supplied,
  only the scenario defined at pkg/<pkg-name> is exported.

  This command implies the 'build' command.

:goa publish [--depot-user <name>] [--pkg <pkg-name>]:
  Archive and sign depot archives generated via the 'export' command.

  This command implies the 'export' command.

:goa add-depot-user <name> --depot-url <url> --pubkey-file <file>:
  Make a new depot user known at a Genode depot as software source
  by specifying a URL and the public key as an ASCII-armored file.

:goa add-depot-user <name> --depot-url <url> --gpg-user-id <id>:
  Make a new depot user known at a Genode depot as software source
  by specifying a URL and the public key as GPG key ID, i.e., the
  email address. This command works only if the GPG keyring already
  contains the specified user ID.

:goa archive-versions:
  Print information about known depot-archive versions.

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
##################

:--verbose:
  Print diagnostic information about the operation of Goa.

:-C <dir>:
  Change into project directory <dir> before executing the command.
