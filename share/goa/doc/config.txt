Goa can be configured using configuration files called 'goarc' or via
command-line arguments.


Configuration files
###################

Upon startup, Goa includes all files named 'goarc' found in the directory
hierarchy up to the project directory, starting with the root directory.
This way, different aspects of Goa can be configured at different scopes.
For example, settings that should be applied to any project of a given
user can be defined at the user's home directory at '~/goarc', settings
shared by multiple Goa projects can be defined at the common parent directory
of those projects, and project-specific settings can live local to the
project directory.

Goa configuration files follow the syntax of Tcl. A configuration value
is defined as follows:

! set <variable-name> <value>

If <value> is a path name, the path can be specified relative to the location
of the 'goarc' file or relative to the user's home directory '~'.


Settings
########

Goa evaluates the following configuration variables.

:project_name:
  This variable overrides the default project name, which is the name of the
  project directory.

:arch:
  The CPU architecture used for building the software.
  Supported values are 'x86_64' and 'arm_v8a'.
  It can be given via the optional '--arch' command-line argument.
  If not specified, Goa targets the CPU architecture of the host machine by
  default, probed via the 'uname -m' command.

:cross_dev_prefix:
  The tool-chain prefix for the Genode cross compiler.
  The default value is "/usr/local/genode/tool/current/bin/genode-x86-".

:rebuild:
  If set to 1 or if the command line argument '--rebuild' is specified,
  a complete rebuild of the software is enforced each time Goa invokes the
  build system. With the default value 0, Goa triggers partial builds.

:jobs:
  The amount of parallelism while building. If not defined, Goa determines
  a reasonable value that corresponds to the number of CPU cores according
  to the information of '/proc/cpuinfo'. This built-in heuristics can be
  overridden by assigning a number to the 'jobs' variable by specifying the
  number to the '--jobs <N>' command-line argument.

:ld_march:
  Architecture-specific linker arguments.
  The default value is "-melf_x86_64".

:olevel:
  Optimization level as passed to the compiler.
  The default value is "-O2".

:depot_dir: The location of the Genode depot. The default is var/depot
  within the project directory. If no such directory exists, Goa creates
  a new directory taking the content of 'share/goa/default_depot/' as
  starting point.

:public_dir: The location of the public directory used for downloading
  and publishing depot archives. The default is var/public within the
  project directory.

:contrib_dir: The location where 3rd-party software imported via the 'import'
  command should be installed. The default is var/contrib within the
  project directory.

:build_dir: The build directory used by the build system. The default
  is var/build/<arch>/ within the project directory.

:abi_dir: The directory where Goa creates ABI stubs for any shared libraries
  used by the project. The default is var/abi/<arch>/ within the project
  directory.

:bin_dir: The directory containing the final build artifacts extracted from
  the build directory upon the completion of the build process. The
  default is var/bin/<arch>/ within the project directory.

:dbg_dir: The directory containing debug info files for the final build
  artifacts. The default is var/dbg/<arch>/ within the project directory.

:run_dir: The directory where Genode test scenarios are assembled when
  executing the 'run' command. The default is var/run/ within the project
  directory.

:common_var_dir:
  If defined, Goa places all generated files in the specified directory
  instead of creating a 'var' directory inside the project directory.
  Within the common var directory, the content of each project is created
  in a subdirectory named after the project.

  This option is useful to keep the source code of a project completely
  separate from any generated files.

:depot_overwrite:
  Whenever Goa encounters the situation where a 'goa export' or 'goa publish'
  command would overwrite existing depot content, it aborts the command.
  Usually, this is an indicator that the project version is due for an
  update. However, while iteratively testing a new version, it is often useful
  to overwrite existing depot content. This can be achieved by setting the
  value to 1 or by specifying the '--depot-overwrite' command-line argument.

:depot_retain:
  Whenever Goa encounters the situation where a 'goa export' or 'goa publish'
  command would overwrite existing depot content, it aborts the command.
  By setting the value to 1 or by specifying the '--depot-retain' command-line
  argument, Goa will not touch the existing depot content but continue the
  command.

:depot_user:
  Depot user name to use when exporting or publishing the project via the
  'export' or 'publish' commands. In order to be able to publish software,
  the GPG keyring must contain a private key that matches the specified
  depot user's pubkey. Alternatively to setting the 'depot_user' variable,
  the name can be specified for the 'export' or 'publish' commands
  via the '--depot-user <name>' argument.

:run_as:
  The 'goa run' command requires several archives from the official genodelabs
  depot. These archives are updated and published along with every Sculpt OS
  release. The archive versions stored in Goa are updated accordingly.
  By setting the 'run_as' variable to your depot user name or by specifying
  the '--run-as <name>' argument, you may load the required archives from your
  own depot instead.

:license:
  When exporting a source archive to a depot, Goa supplements a license
  file to the source archive, which is expected to be located as a file
  named LICENSE in the project directory. If many Goa projects share the same
  license, it would be cumbersome to spill LICENSE files everywhere.
  In this case, a path to a license file can be supplied via the 'license'
  configuration variable, or the '--license' command-line argument.

:debug:
  If set to 1, Goa may use debug build mode to produce binaries with debug
  information (details depend on the build system). Furthermore, Goa extracts
  debug info files from the produced binaries and adds corresponding
  .gnu_debuglink sections. The 'goa run' command tries downloading required dbg
  archives and makes the contained debug info files available in the .debug
  subdirectory of run_dir. If set to 1, the 'goa export' and 'goa publish'
  commands are instructed to publish dbg archives along with the bin archives.
  Alternatively to defining the configuration variable, the debug build mode
  can be enabled via the '--debug' command-line argument.

:with_backtrace:
  If set to 1, Goa adds the flag '-fno-omit-frame-pointer' to the compiler
  options in order to enable the use of backtraces. Alternatively to defining
  the configuration variable, the option can be enabled via the
  '--with-backtrace' command-line argument.

:binary_name:
  Goa's backtrace command tries to identify the name of the binary from the log
  output. If the component's name is different than the name of its binary, you
  must set this configuration variable or use the '--binary-name' command-line
  argument.

:warn_strict:
  If set to 1, Goa passes Genode's default strict C++ warning flags to the
  build system. It is implicitly enabled whenever a project uses the Genode
  'base' API. By explicitly defining the value, strict warnings can be
  disabled for a Genode-API-using project, or enabled for any non-Genode-API
  project. Alternatively to defining the configuration variable, the
  strict warnings can be enabled or disabled via the '--warn-strict' and
  '--no-warn-strict' command-line arguments.

:sculpt_version:
  Determines the Sculpt version for which a depot index is exported and
  published. The default value can either be overridden by setting this
  configuration variable in a custom 'goarc' file or via the
  '--sculpt-version' command-line argument.

:target:
  Specifies the run target used for 'goa run'. The default value is 'linux'.
  The value can be overridden by setting this configuration variable or by
  providing the '--target' command-line argument. See 'goa help targets' for
  more details.

:target_opt(<option>):
  The target_opt array stores target-specific configurations. Alternatively to
  setting this variable in a custom 'goarc' file, you may provide
  '--target-opt-<option>' command-line arguments. See 'goa help targets' for
  more details.

:version(<user>/<type>/<name>):
  The version array is indexed with a depot-archive path and contains the
  version to be assumed for this archive.
  The <user> corresponds to a depot user (a software source).
  The <type> can be 'src', 'raw', 'api', or 'pkg'.
  The <name> is the name of the archive.
  Goa comes with a data base of default versions, which can be found at
  share/goa/goarc.
  It is possible to instruct Goa to obtain version information directly
  from a Genode source tree by using the 'versions_from_genode_dir' variable.
  To display Goa's currently known version information, you may use the
  'goa archive-versions' command.
  Version information can also be provided via '--version-<user>/<type>/<name>'
  command-line arguments.

:versions_from_genode_dir:
  If set to the root of a Genode source tree, Goa determines the package
  versions from the depot recipes stored in the Genode source tree.
  Since the corresponding archives are likely not available in the official
  genodelabs depot, you probably want to guide Goa to your personal depot by
  setting the 'run_as' variable.

:search_dir:
  By default, Goa uses the original working directory for looking up versions
  of other Goa projects. This can be changed by setting the 'search_dir'
  variable in a custom 'goarc' file or by using the '--search-dir <dir>'
  command-line argument.

:cc_cxx_opt_std:
  Overwrite C++ standard. The default is '-std=gnu++20'.
